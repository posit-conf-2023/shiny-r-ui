We kindly ask you to complete the following tasks prior to the workshop so you can get started.\n\nCreate an account on Posit Cloud (if you don’t have one).\nOpen the following Posit Cloud project and click on Start to create your own copy of the project. If you’re automatically asked to restore packages, answer yes. Otherwise run renv::restore() in the R console. Note: our activity project leverages {renv} for better reproducibility. It roughly takes 20-30 minutes to restore all the packages from the renv.lock file on Posit Cloud (less locally if binaries are installed).\n\n\n\nLocal setup (backup)\nHowever, it is more than recommended to have a backup on your personal laptop and that you have relevant software installed and configured prior to the workshop start.\n\nLocal setup: please be ready with recent versions of both R and RStudio. See: https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html#install-r-rstudio\nLocal setup: it is essential that you setup Git/GitHub in advance: https://happygitwithr.com/workshops.html#pre-workshop-set-up\nOptional: Install VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), with R language support (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r).\nEither with RStudio IDE or VSCode, clone the exercise from here and restore the {renv} packages (automatically or doing renv::restore() in the R console).\n\n\n\nAny questions?\nIf you have questions in advance of the workshop, please answer to this thread: https://community.rstudio.com/t/web-design-for-shiny-developers-workshop-posit-conf-2023/172257.\n\n\nHow we will communicate during the workshop\nDuring the workshop, we will be using Discord as our main communication method. To make the process go smoothly: 1. Please sign up for an account if you don’t already have one. 2. Make sure your display name is the one you used to register for the conference. 3. In your “About Me”, put the name of your workshop(s).\n\n\nFurther instructions\nCloser to the start of the conference, we will invite you to the posit::conf Discord server, share the repository containing the slides and further instructions to be ready.\nLooking forward to meeting you!"
