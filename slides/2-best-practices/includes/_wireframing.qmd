## What?

<br/>

Wireframing is the action of drawing an app design on the paper or with a software:

- Shows layout.
- Shows user interactions.
- Optional: Colors/typography.

## Different fidelity levels

## Why?

<br/>

::: incremental
- Have a physical representation of the goal to reach (for you and the end users).
- Quickly realise potential caveats: fail early rather than too late.
- End users will help you to get the right map.

## How: 💻 With a software/app?

<br/>

- Excalidraw (free).
- Figma (plans).
- Balsamiq (pay).

## 🥼 Your turn: open `{shinyMons2}` `r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0, top = 0)`

1. Open the Posit cloud space shared with you and click on the
`shinyMons2` assignment.

<br/>

![](./../../assets/images/2-best-practices/wireframing/open-posit-cloud.png){width=100% fig-align="center"}

2. Open `./app.R`, run the app and discuss.

## About `{shinyMons2}`

<br/>

This is an __uglyfied__ pokemon app[^first-gen] suffering from few UX/UI issues:

::: incremental

  - Wrong color choice and typography.
  - Confusing layout.
  - Confusing error messages.
  - ...

:::

. . .

<br/>

You got it, this app s*cks 🙊

[^first-gen]: Only the first 151 pokemons are considered.

## `{shinyMons2}` structure [^flow-pkg]

<br/>

This app is composed of 7 modules (you can check in `./R`).

<br/>

[^flow-pkg]: This diagram is powered by `{flow}` by Antoine [Fabri](https://github.com/moodymudskipper).

## 🥼 Your turn: `{shinyMons2}` data `r countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0, top = 0)`

<br/>

`poke_data` is a nested list containing all relevant data for 151 pokemons.

```{=html}
<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="./../../assets/images/2-best-practices/wireframing/poke-data.html" title="Poke data explorator"></iframe>
```

## What if I don't know anything about Pokemons? 🤔

<br/>

What would we expect to know from a Pokemon?

::: incremental

- What's its __name__? Type? Any detail counts!
- Is it __powerful__?
- __Where__ to find it?
- How it __looks__ like (__sprites__ are images).
- Whether it is an __evolution__ from a child pokemon.
- ...

:::


## `{shinyMons2}` redesign steps

<br/>

From there, we'll cover the redesign step by step:

::: incremental

- Do the wireframing from `poke_data`.
- Create the corresponding layout with `{bslib}`.
- You'll fine tune the `{bslib}` theme (colors and typography).
- ...

:::


## 🥼 Your turn: wireframing `r countdown(minutes = 45, seconds = 0, top = 0)`

<br/> 

1. Open the `shinyMons2` project in the Posit Cloud [space](https://posit.cloud/spaces/400773/join?access_code=ajwkws91bhF-IhEXDVWH9-0mukSUF3jiETCkzrgt).
2. Run `pkgload::load_all()`.
3. Considering the available `poke_data` data, with the 🖊 pen, 📜 paper and 🧠 brain approach discussed earlier, propose a new design for `{shinyMons2}`.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="Hint"}
Only focus on the UI, not on the server part. Ask yourself: what would people want to know about their favorite Pokemon?

Time to check what you all did `r countdown(minutes = 15)`
