## 👀 Where to go now?

<br/>

As you may imagine, we only scratched the surface of web design. We'd like to advise you to:

::: incremental
- Watch UX videos such as from the [NNgroup](https://www.youtube.com/@NNgroup) (Nielsen Norman Group).
- Investigate __human psychology__ (emotional design): [Laws](https://lawsofux.com/) of UX.
- Simply talk to people.
