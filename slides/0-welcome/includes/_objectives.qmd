## 👥 Discover your workshop team

<br/>

We acknowledge not everyone is a Git specialist, nor a Shiny modules expert. Therefore, to ease the workshop exercises, you've been all assigned a __team__.

. . .

<br/>

Design your __team lead__, who will be responsible for (only during the main activity):

- Creating the __team branch__ on GitHub.
- Regularly __commiting__ the activity code to GitHub.
- Raising team __issues__.
